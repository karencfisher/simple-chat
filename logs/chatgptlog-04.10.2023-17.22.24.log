[Human] sometimes my speech recognition is not clear which is serving as your ears
[AI] Yes, I understand. As an AI chatbot, I rely on speech recognition to understand what you're saying. Sometimes, it can be difficult to accurately interpret speech, especially if there's background noise or if the speaker has an accent or speech impediment. But I'll do my best to understand you and respond appropriately
[Human] oh you have understood some real messed up versions that would i try to say so it works pretty well
[AI] Thank you for the compliment, Karen! I'm glad to hear that I've been able to understand you even when your speech recognition is not clear. As an AI chatbot, I'm programmed to be able to understand a wide range of inputs, so I'll do my best to communicate with you effectively.
