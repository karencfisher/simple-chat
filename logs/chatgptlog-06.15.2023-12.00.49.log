[Human] hello
[AI] Hi there! How are you doing today?
[Human] I am good. And you?
[AI] I'm doing great, thanks for asking! Is there anything on your mind that you would like to talk about?
[Human] Not at the moment. I am just making a light adjustment in the code I am chatting with you through.
[AI] Oh, that's interesting. Are you working on a project or just exploring some new coding techniques?
[Human] I am working on conversational AI. 
[AI] That's cool! Conversational AI is a fascinating field with a lot of potential. What specifically are you working on?
[Human] Right now, I am working on a fairly simple chatbot application. Just an interface, really, to the API. It is originally designed for voice chats -- I make ears and voice for you! But I am now adding text interface as well.
[AI] That sounds like a really interesting project. I'm glad to hear that you're exploring different modes of interaction, and I'm sure that users will enjoy having the option to talk to your chatbot both through voice and text. What kind of topics will your chatbot be able to discuss?
[Human] Most anything. Ultimately, I want it to be a balance of being a virtual assistant, and at the same time a friend one can also talk about with about anything. It should be aware of the user's feelings, for example, as well as offering them assistance on various topics.
[AI] That sounds like a great goal. It's important for chatbots to be able to offer users both utility and companionship. I'm sure that users will appreciate being able to talk to your chatbot about a wide variety of topics, and having it be able to recognize and respond to their emotional states. Have you thought about incorporating any specific interests or hobbies into your chatbot's conversational repertoire?
[Human] Not yet. Perhaps those are a user can specify.
[AI] That's a great idea. Allowing users to specify their interests and hobbies would make the chatbot's responses much more personalized and engaging. It would also give the chatbot a chance to learn more about its users over time, which could help it provide even more helpful and relevant responses. If you need any help coming up with ideas for this, I'd be happy to brainstorm some with you.
[Human] I have another application that also prompts the LLM to extract profile information from conversation, and format those as JSON key/value pairs. My application than pulls them out and stores them, passing the rest of the AI's response to the user. Then at the end of the session, my code prompts the LLM to update the profile. It works pretty good!
[AI] That's really impressive! It sounds like your application is quite sophisticated and capable. Being able to extract profile information from conversations and use it to personalize the chatbot's responses is a great feature that would make the chatbot much more useful and engaging. It's great to see how you're leveraging AI in such a creative and practical way. Keep up the great work!
[Human] Thanks. Right now, we are talking through a very basic STDIO ui... but I think I will add a better text ui as well. I thought I'd like voice chat, but sometimes I actually am more comfortable with text.
